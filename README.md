Paper and Master's thesis: Design and implementation of a recommender system for the selection and application of suitable XAI methods

## Abstract
In order to encourage the use of Explainable AI (XAI) and thereby improve the interpretability of
complex AI systems, the question of how users can be assisted when selecting and subsequently applying
suitable XAI methods is investigated. To help a user select an appropriate XAI method for
black-box models by means of recommendations, a web-based XAI recommendation system (XAIR)
is designed and implemented. Based on the userâ€™s inputs incorporating their preferences, the most
appropriate model-agnostic and post-hoc applicable XAI methods are suggested. According to the
Requirements Driven DSR framework an initial requirements analysis in the form of qualitative, semistructured
interviews is conducted. To identify and formalize context-specific criteria influencing the
applicability of an XAI method, a measurement for its suitability is determined. Due to the vagueness
of the existing XAI expert knowledge, fuzzy logic is of particular relevance in this context. The modular
software resulting from this work can be further extended with XAI methods and other criteria.
Furthermore, it can be used standalone as a web application or automated within an ML pipeline. A
user evaluation indicates that the XAIR simplifies the selection of an XAI method and its implementation
by providing a well-founded recommendation. Moreover, it also increases the motivation for the
user to actually apply the XAI method by outlining more targeted, in-depth information about the
respective method.
